## **R**egionfree **Y**outube **D**ownloader. Get **RYD** of censorship.

This script will ensure it has access to ffmpeg, 7zip, and tor. It will then take whatever youtube video/short link you provide, and attempt to download it using countries with better protections against censorship. It will convert the video to a system safe name in the .mp4 format, which you can then watch at your leisure.

Remember that with great power comes great responsibility. We don't ever want to saturate the tor network, but if the occasion comes (and it has, hence the creation of this script) and censorship needs to be avoided, this should do the trick. Tested on Windows, but I did make an attempt to have it also ready for other operating systems, though it may need some testing and minor alterations.
